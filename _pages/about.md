I am an [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/) PhD student currently in the [Computational Principles of Intelligence Lab](https://hcai-munich.com) in Munich. I am supervised by both [Eric Schulz](https://hcai-munich.com/eric.html) (LMU & Helmholtz AI) and [Jane X. Wang](http://www.janexwang.com/) (Google DeepMind).

Broadly, I am interested in computational models of human behavior to try to leverage these insights in Machine Learning. So far in my PhD, I have been exploring how Large Language Models behave and take decision using the cogntive science lens. I am also interested to use these insights to inject human-like priors into RL agents.

When not doing research, I enjoy football, bouldering, skiing, surfing, calisthenics and dancing.
